for this exercise we are creating a crossword puzzle from the end to the back. first we create possible values for
each variable - slots where words can be entered. We work our way back by going from a solved crossword back
step by step untill we get an empty puzzle with a way to solve it as well. The function backtrace does this logid
in a recoursive way

select unassigned varibale is our way of guessing, it allows us to check what value we could assign a variable
it does this by iterating over all possible words and choosing the one that best fits our critera
of the largest set of values and smallest amount of invalidated crossowers with other words
For the last part we use domain values function which returns this very degree(invalidated neighbours)

consistency ensures that we dont have duplicate words, that overlapping words to overlap correctly
and that all words are exactly as long as their slots

ac3, revise and enforce consistancy ensure that each variable is consistent within itself as well as its
neighbours, be this in size, overlapping words and letters as well as sections
